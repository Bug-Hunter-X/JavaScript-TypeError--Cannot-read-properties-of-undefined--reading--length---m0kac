This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: attempting to access properties of undefined variables. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.  The error occurs because the `foo` function doesn't handle the `undefined` case appropriately.  The solution adds a check for `undefined` before accessing the `length` property, preventing the error.
